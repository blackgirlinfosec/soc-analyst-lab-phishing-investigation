# Phishing Email Triage Lab

> A beginner-friendly, real-world email phishing investigation lab using free tools and basic SOC analyst techniques.

---

## 🧠 Lab Overview

In this case study, I investigate a real phishing email that was attempting to trick the recipient into clicking a fake email verification link. I follow the steps a SOC analyst might take to analyze the email header, inspect the body, identify indicators of compromise (IOCs), and document findings in a clear format.

This lab simulates real-world email triage tasks and shows how I would respond to a potential phishing incident in a SOC environment.
