This phishing email claimed to be from an email administrator and warned the user about failed email deliveries. The sender used a spoofed domain and sent the email from 38.68.46.250, which is listed on at least one blacklist.

The email urged the recipient to click a link to verify their information. The link directed to knu.edu.af, which appeared to be hosted on a foreign server and used Cloudflare. The page is currently inactive, but the structure and naming suggest it once hosted a fake login page.

The email failed SPF, DKIM, and DMARC checks. These email authentication failures support the assessment that the message was not legitimate.

Based on the header, URL, and behavioral analysis, this email was part of a credential phishing campaign.
